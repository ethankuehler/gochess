This is my own personal project for a chess engine written in go. I wanted to use this as an opertunity to learn go and see what it has to offer over somthing better for this use case like C++ or Rust.
I understand that this go isnt the right tool for the job, but if people are writting chess engines in python and java why not go? it cant be that bad can it?

Anyway reow
Ethan.
